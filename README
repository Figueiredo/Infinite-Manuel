Infinite Manuel Bros is an open source HTML5 adaptation
of Infinite Mario by Markus Persson (http://www.mojang.com/notch/mario/)

All graphics are alterered (hopefully enough) to avoid any possible copyright
issues with Nintendo

It's an adaptation than actually a port due to the significant differences
between javascript and Java
